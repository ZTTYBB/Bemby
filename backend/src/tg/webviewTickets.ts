 * Why it is needed: a Mini App reads `location.pathname` to route itself, so it has to own `/`
 * on whatever origin serves it, and Bemby's own panel already owns `/` on its origin. Served
 * under a path prefix instead, the app's router matches nothing and it renders an empty page.
 * `window.location` cannot be shimmed, so a separate origin is the only way.
 *
 * Keeping it on the same registrable domain matters twice over: the ticket cookie is then
 * same-site, so it needs no `Secure` and works over plain http; and the origin is still
 * distinct, so the page cannot reach the panel's storage where the session token lives.
